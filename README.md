# Wirelength-Prediction
This repository contains source code for my article "Neural Network Methods for Wirelength Estimation at the Placement Stage"

Here are presented:

1. Importing libs
2. Class 'loadBlockfromDataset_v2' for convertation original data to PyG object
3. Class 'Training' with a lot of methods for model`s training used in article
4. Class 'graph_dataset' to build InMemoryDataset object for dataset storage
5. Classes for Linear, XGBoost, GCN, GAT and SAGE models
